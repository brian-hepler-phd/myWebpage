      subtitle: ''

        Iâ€™m a research mathematician and educator with 13+ years of experience working at the intersection of abstract theory and practical computation. My expertise lies in **relational structures, category theory, and topological methods**, and I specialize in translating these concepts into **efficient data models, algorithms**, and **mathematical infrastructure for machine learning and quantum computing**.

        Iâ€™ve published 5 peer-reviewed research articles and presented at over 20 international conferences. Iâ€™m actively building on my mathematical background to develop tools and frameworks that bridge theory and practice, with applications in machine learning, quantum computing, and data science.

        Iâ€™ve also taught university-level mathematics for more than a decade, most recently designing and delivering a course on ["Lie Groups with Applications"](https://quantumformalism.academy/lie-groups-with-applications) through Quantum Formalism Academy.

        From 2023â€“2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the algebraic analysis group at **IMJ-PRG (Sorbonne UniversitÃ©)**, working with FranÃ§ois Loeser on the **FSMP-funded** project *Condensed Mathematics, Ind-Sheaves, and Irregular Singularities*. Before that, I held research appointments at **UWâ€“Madison**, including a Van Vleck Visiting Assistant Professorship and a later honorary fellowship, collaborating with Laurentiu Maxim in **geometry and topology**.

        I earned my Ph.D. from **Northeastern University** in 2019 under David B. Massey, with a dissertation on some invariants of complex analytic singularities titled *Hypersurface Normalizations and Numerical Invariants*. You can learn more on my [Research](/research) page.
