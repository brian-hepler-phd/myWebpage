I have over a decade of experience teaching university-level mathematics courses across a broad spectrum — from introductory calculus to graduate-level topology.

My approach centers on clarity, structure, and creating an environment where students feel both supported and challenged. I care deeply about making mathematics accessible and meaningful to all audiences, and I’ve consistently earned high student evaluations reflecting this commitment.
