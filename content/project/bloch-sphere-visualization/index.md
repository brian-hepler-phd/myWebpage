An interactive visualization tool for exploring the Bloch sphere representation of qubit states and unitary operations. Built with `streamlit`, this app lets users intuitively rotate states on the sphere using SU(2) matrices and observe their geometric action in real time.

<!--more-->

Developed as a supplement for the *Lie Groups with Applications* course with Quantum Formalism, this project helps students and researchers:

- Understand how elements of SU(2) act as rotations of qubit states
- Explore parameterized gates (e.g. \( R_x(\theta), R_y(\theta), R_z(\theta) \))
- Visualize the action of matrix exponentials in real-time
- Develop geometric intuition for quantum gate design

Features:

- Real-time interactive Bloch sphere using Plotly
- User-controlled sliders for axis and angle of rotation
- Clear linkage between algebraic and geometric representations
- Educational framing for classroom demos or independent study
