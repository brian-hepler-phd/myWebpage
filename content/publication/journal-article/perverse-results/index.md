  We present results on the cohomology of Milnor fibers inside parameterized hypersurfaces that follow directly from techniques in the category of perverse sheaves. In particular, we define a new perverse sheaf, the multiple-point complex of the parameterization, which naturally arises when studying how the multiple-point set influences the topology of the Milnor fiber.

  Applications to stable unfoldings of finite maps with isolated instabilities are also discussed.
