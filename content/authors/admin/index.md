    summary: |
      This proposal focused on a long-standing open problem in singularity theory known as Lê’s Conjecture, which concerns the equisingularity of complex analytic surfaces with one-dimensional singular loci.

      My approach, in collaboration with Laurentiu Maxim, reformulates this conjecture using the theory of mixed Hodge modules and perverse sheaves. Building on my earlier work on non-isolated singularities, we reinterpret the vanishing cycles complex φ_f[−1] ℚ_ℂ³[3] as a central object and reduce Lê’s Conjecture to a statement about the purity and semi-simplicity of its non-unipotent part as a mixed Hodge module.

      This framework provides a new perspective that connects deep topological properties of singularities to their analytic structure, with the potential to resolve a conjecture that has remained open for nearly 40 years.

## About Me

I'm a research mathematician and educator with over a decade of experience bridging abstract mathematics and applied computation. My background is in category theory, geometry, and singularity theory, and I’ve recently focused on translating these tools into the worlds of quantum computing, machine learning, and topological data analysis.

In both research and teaching, I aim to make complex ideas accessible and useful — whether by designing clean mathematical infrastructure, writing interpretable code, or building hands-on tools for students and researchers.
