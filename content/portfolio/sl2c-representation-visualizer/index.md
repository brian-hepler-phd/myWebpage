An interactive notebook that illustrates representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$ by implementing the action of its generators on homogeneous polynomials. Designed for Lecture 4 (*Representation Theory*) of the *Lie Groups with Applications* course at Quantum Formalism.

### Goal

To explore the action of the $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$ generators — the weight operator $H$, raising operator $E$, and lowering operator  $F$ — on the space of homogeneous polynomials $V_m$ in two variables $(z_1, z_2)$, and to visualize the ladder structure of irreducible representations.

### Key Activities

- Defined the representation space $V_m$, consisting of degree-$m $homogeneous polynomials in two variables
- Implemented $H, E$, and $ F$ as differential operators acting on symbolic expressions in `sympy`
- Built an interactive interface for applying these operators to a given polynomial using `ipywidgets`
- Demonstrated weight shifts and the full ladder structure for each irreducible $V_m$

### Technologies & Concepts

- Python, SymPy (symbolic differentiation & polynomial manipulation)
- `ipywidgets` for interactivity
- Representation theory of  $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$
- Differential operators on polynomial spaces
