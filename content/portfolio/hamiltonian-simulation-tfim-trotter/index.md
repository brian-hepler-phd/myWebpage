A Python notebook exploring Hamiltonian simulation of the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) using Trotter–Suzuki approximations. This project provides a self-contained, pedagogical example of how to approximate time evolution $e^{-iHt}$ for non-commuting Hamiltonians.

<!--more-->

Topics covered include:

- Definition and matrix representation of the TFIM Hamiltonian
- Exact diagonalization of small systems using NumPy
- First- and second-order Trotterization of the time evolution operator
- Lie-theoretic perspective on operator splitting and BCH approximations

The notebook is designed as supplemental material for the *Lie Groups with Applications* course with Quantum Formalism.
