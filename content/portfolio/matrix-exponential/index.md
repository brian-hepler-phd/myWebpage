An interactive Python notebook that visualizes the matrix exponential in real-time for $2 \times 2$ matrices. Built as a conceptual tool to illustrate the flow generated by a matrix in the plane, this project bridges linear algebra, differential equations, and Lie group theory.

<!--more-->

This visualization tool was developed as part of the *Lie Groups with Applications* course with Quantum Formalism, and is ideal for students, researchers, and instructors looking to understand:

- How to compute the matrix exponential numerically
- How to visualize matrix Lie groups through their action on vectors
- The role of the exponential map in Lie group structure
- Real-time animation using `matplotlib` and `ipywidgets`

Features:

- Interactive sliders for adjusting entries of a real $2 \times 2$ matrix
- Dynamic vector field updates and trajectory overlays
- Modular code structure for reuse in teaching notebooks
