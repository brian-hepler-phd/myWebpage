An interactive 3D notebook for visualizing the Lie bracket structure of 𝖘𝖚(2) using a geometric cross-product analogy. Developed as a demonstration for Lecture 3 (*Matrix Lie Algebras*) in the *Lie Groups with Applications* course at Quantum Formalism.

### Key Goals

- Compute the Lie bracket [X, Y] = XY - YX for elements in 𝖘𝖚(2)
- Map each element of 𝖘𝖚(2) to a vector in R^3 using the Pauli basis
- Visualize \( X \), \( Y \), and \( [X, Y] \) as 3D vectors on the unit sphere
- Demonstrate that the Lie bracket corresponds to the cross product in this representation

### Tools & Concepts

- Basis derived from scaled Pauli matrices: \( i\sigma_x/2, i\sigma_y/2, i\sigma_z/2 \)
- Lie algebra computations with NumPy
- 3D visualization via `matplotlib` and `mplot3d`
- Interactive control with `ipywidgets`

This notebook illustrates deep algebraic structure through concrete geometric visuals — an ideal companion to coursework on Lie algebras, cross products, and matrix groups.
